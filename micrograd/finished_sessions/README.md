The notebook named session_1 contains what we covered in the first session, while the notebook session_2 also contains what we plan to cover in the second session.

(Trick to opening any jupyter notebook in colab: open it on github, and then change `github` to `githubtocolab`!)

We suggest to have both open, type along with the first one and if you get stuck, check with the second one.

For convenience typing along, we've placed the `Value` class at the very top, as you will be making changes there frequently. It might be convenient to minimize the upcoming sections so that at the bottom of the notebook is what we're currently watching and you can switch quickly.

For a completed `Value` class you can also refer to [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master/micrograd/engine.py).
