General advice on applying machine learning

- Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ8T9b-uGVE&t=1500s) (start at minute 25:00) by Andrew Ng of Stanford University with advice on how to apply machine learning algorithms. The key message is that it is crucial that you understand why your implementation works or doesn't work if you want to be successful in applying machine learning to solve your problems.
- A more [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ka6a13S9I) of Andrew Ng about more ore less the same topic. And [slides](https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/2016/Slides/6203-Slides.pdf) from a related presentation of Andrew Ng that includes topics such as end-to-end learning and human performance.
