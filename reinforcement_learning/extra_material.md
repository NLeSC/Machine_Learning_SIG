## Extra material for advanced reinforcement learning course

### Course information
Udemy online course "Advanced AI: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python".  
Course link: https://www.udemy.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-python/  
Code: https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/tree/master/rl2

### Necessary background knowledge
Next to general knowledge/experience with deep learning the course asks for hands-on experience with
+ Markov Decision Proccesses (MDPs)
+ Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, and Temporal Difference Learning to solve MDPs

The course contains a brief review section, but only enough to recap. 
The idea is to list further material for a quick introduction to the necessary background knowledge here.
But also add links to code examples, vidos, articles etc. that might be usefull during the course...

## Extra material (from HSE "Practical RL" course)
The "Practical RL" course by HSE and coursera contains quite a lot of interesting links, materials, code, videos etc.
The level of the course is somewhere between the 1st and 2nd Udemy/lazy-programmer RL course, so it covers a lot of the background in more detail, such as MDPs, Qlearning etc.).

+ Corresponding github repo: https://github.com/yandexdataschool/practical_rl
Containing interesting notebooks, code, links etc. 

## Extra material (miscellaneous)
#### MDPs (Markov Decision Proccesses)
+ Quick to read, accessible blog post on MDPs:

+ **NOT** quick to read, but used as resource in both the coursera/HSE and the Udemy/lazyprogrammer course:
A full textbook on reinforcement-learning by Sutton & Barto. Theory/math heavy.
