## Background material for advanced reinforcement learning course

### Course information
Udemy online course "Advanced AI: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Python":
https://www.udemy.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-python/

### Necessary background knowledge
Next to general knowledge/experience with deep learning the course asks for hands-on experience with
+ Markov Decision Proccesses (MDPs)
+ Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, and Temporal Difference Learning to solve MDPs

The course contains a brief review section, but only enough to recap. 
The idea is to list further material for a quick introduction to the necessary background knowledge here.

## Extra material
#### MDPs (Markov Decision Proccesses)
