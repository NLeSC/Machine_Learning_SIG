# SIG mission

* Keep up to date with machine learning techniques necessary for the current and future NLeSc projects
* Discuss current projects that involve machine learning and provide guidance on chooosing suitable methods and tools
* Advice other scientist on feasibility regarding applying ML methods on their data

## Sessions
### Every second Monday (currently these are the odd weeks) between 11:00 and 12:00 at Compass. 

### Upcoming sessions:
Upcoming topics as well as suggestions of interesting material for future sessions are organized here: https://github.com/NLeSC/Machine_Learning_SIG/projects/1
